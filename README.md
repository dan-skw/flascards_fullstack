# Flashcards Fullstack Application

---

## Basic information

An application to stack decks of flashcards simillar to notes. Allows the user to create multiple decks of various categories and add notes in each of them. Data is stored on database, so it won't be removed after closing/crashing. Created while learning for my side project which required learning node.js/express and how to link frontend with backend.

### Tools

1. frontend:
   -- Vite
   --Typescript with React
   -- TailwindCSS
2. backend
   -- Node.js with Express
   -- MongoDB with Mongoose

### How to run

while on main folder
`cd client `
`npm run dev`
then comeback to main folder and in bash terminal
`cd server`
`npm run dev`
which will enable server to run, go to the localhost created by Vite.
